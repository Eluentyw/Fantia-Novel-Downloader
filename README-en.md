# Fantia Novel Downloader v1.1

## Overview

This is a Python script designed to download novel posts from the creator support platform "Fantia" and save them as local text files.

## Features

*   **Batch Processing**: Download novels from multiple fan clubs in a single run.
*   **Scope Filtering**: Choose to download "all," "paid only," or "free only" posts.
*   **External Configuration**: Authentication credentials and operational settings are managed in a `config.ini` file for safety and ease of maintenance.
*   **Organized Folder Structure**: Automatically creates subdirectories for each fan club to keep downloaded files organized.

## ⚠︎ Disclaimer

*   This tool should be used only for personal backup and educational purposes.
*   The author is not responsible for any issues that may arise from the use of this tool, including but not limited to account restrictions.

## 1. Requirements

*   Python 3.6 or higher
*   Required Python libraries:
    *   `requests`
    *   `beautifulsoup4`

## 2. Setup

1.  **Clone or download the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Eluentyw/Fantia-Novel-Downloader.git
    cd Fantia-Novel-Downloader
    ```
    Alternatively, download the ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

2.  **Install required libraries**
    Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4
    ```

3.  **Prepare configuration files**
    *   In the same directory as `Fantia-novel-downloader_en.py`, create a text file named `DL-links.txt`.
    *   The `config.ini` file will be generated automatically on the first run.

## 3. Configuration

The application's behavior is controlled by two files: `config.ini` and `DL-links.txt`. **You do not need to edit the main script (`Fantia-novel-downloader_en.py`).**

### 3.1. `config.ini` Settings

This file is automatically generated on the first run. Open it and fill in the required information.

```ini
[Authentication]
user_agent = Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/72.0.3626.121 Safari/537.36
cookie = Please paste the Cookie string copied from your browser here
x_csrf_token = Please paste the X-Csrf-Token copied from your browser here

[Settings]
# Download scope: specify one of all, paid, or free
download_scope = all
# Root folder name for downloaded files
root_output_dir = fantia_novels
# Delay in seconds between requests. Recommended: 1.0 or higher to reduce server load
request_delay = 1.5
```

#### **How to Obtain Authentication Credentials (`cookie` and `x_csrf_token`)**

These are essential for proving to Fantia's server that you are a legitimate, logged-in user.

1.  Log in to Fantia in your PC web browser (Chrome is recommended).
2.  Navigate to **any novel post page that you have permission to view**.
3.  Press `F12` to open the Developer Tools and select the **"Network"** tab.
4.  In the filter bar, click on "Fetch/XHR".
5.  Press `F5` to reload the page.
6.  From the list of communications that appear, click on an item with a name like 1234567 and confirm that the request URL looks like https://fantia.jp/api/v1/posts/1234567.
7.  In the details pane on the right, find the **"Headers"** tab and scroll down to the **"Request Headers"** section.
8.  Copy the following two values and paste them into your `config.ini`:
    *   **`cookie`**: The **entire line** of text, which is very long and contains `_session_id=...`.
    *   **`x-csrf-token`**: The token string, which consists of random-looking characters.

> **Note:** These credentials may expire over time or after logging out. If the script stops working, repeat these steps to get the latest values.

### 3.2. `DL-links.txt` Settings

In this file, list the URLs of the **novel post list pages** for the fan clubs you want to download from. Place one URL per line.

**Example:**
```
https://fantia.jp/fanclubs/123456/posts
https://fantia.jp/fanclubs/123456/posts?tag=novel
https://fantia.jp/fanclubs/123456/posts?tag=%E5%B0%8F%E8%AA%AC
```
> **Tip:** The `?tag=...` part is necessary if a fan club uses a specific tag for its novels. If you want to download all posts regardless of tags, remove that part of the URL.

## 4. Usage

Once all configuration is complete, run the script from your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python Fantia-novel-downloader_en.py
```

The program will start and process each URL listed in `DL-links.txt`.

## 5. Output Structure

The script will create the `root_output_dir` (default: `fantia_novels`) and generate subdirectories within it for each fan club.

```
.
├── Fantia-novel-downloader_en.py
├── config.ini
├── DL-links.txt
│
└── fantia_novels/
    ├── Fanclub A (Creator A)/
    │   ├── Novel Title 1.txt
    │   └── Novel Title 2.txt
    │
    └── Fanclub B (Creator B)/
        ├── Novel Title 3.txt
        └── ...
```

## 6. Troubleshooting

*   **"Login failed" error**:
    *   The `cookie` value in `config.ini` is likely incorrect or has expired. Follow the steps in "How to Obtain Authentication Credentials" to set the latest value.
*   **Errors occur while fetching individual posts**:
    *   The `x_csrf_token` in `config.ini` may have expired. Set the latest value, just like the `cookie`.
*   **No posts are found for a specific fan club**:
    *   Check the URL in `DL-links.txt`. Ensure it points to the correct post list page, including any specific tags the creator might be using for novels.
